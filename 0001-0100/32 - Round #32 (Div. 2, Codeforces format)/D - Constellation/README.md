## Problem Statement

A star map in Berland is a checked field n ΓÇë├ùΓÇë m squares. In each square there is or there is not a star. The favourite constellation of all Berland's astronomers is the constellation of the Cross. This constellation can be formed by any 5 stars so, that for some integer x ( radius of the constellation ) the following is true: 

 
- the 2nd is on the same vertical line as the 1st, but x squares up 
- the 3rd is on the same vertical line as the 1st, but x squares down 
- the 4th is on the same horizontal line as the 1st, but x squares left 
- the 5th is on the same horizontal line as the 1st, but x squares right 

Such constellations can be very numerous, that's why they are numbered with integers from 1 on the following principle: when two constellations are compared, the one with a smaller radius gets a smaller index; if their radii are equal ΓÇö the one, whose central star if higher than the central star of the other one; if their central stars are at the same level ΓÇö the one, whose central star is to the left of the central star of the other one.

Your task is to find the constellation with index k by the given Berland's star map.

## Input

The first line contains three integers n , m and k ( 1ΓÇëΓëñΓÇë n ,ΓÇë m ΓÇëΓëñΓÇë300,ΓÇë1ΓÇëΓëñΓÇë k ΓÇëΓëñΓÇë3┬╖10 7 ) ΓÇö height and width of the map and index of the required constellation respectively. The upper-left corner has coordinates (1,ΓÇë1) , and the lower-right ΓÇö ( n ,ΓÇë m ) . Then there follow n lines, m characters each ΓÇö description of the map. j -th character in i -th line is ┬½*┬╗, if there is a star in the corresponding square, and ┬½.┬╗ if this square is empty.

## Output

If the number of the constellations is less than k , output -1 . Otherwise output 5 lines, two integers each ΓÇö coordinates of the required constellation. Output the stars in the following order: central, upper, lower, left, right.
